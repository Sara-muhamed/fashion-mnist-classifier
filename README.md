# 👕 Fashion MNIST Classifier

A deep learning project using **TensorFlow** to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

---

## 📋 Project Overview
- Dataset: Fashion MNIST (60,000 training + 10,000 testing grayscale images, 28x28 pixels each)
- Goal: Train a neural network to classify images into 10 categories:
  `T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot`

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data normalization  
- Multi-layer neural network (Sequential model)  
- Comparison between **Adam** and **SGD** optimizers  
- Accuracy evaluation on test set
